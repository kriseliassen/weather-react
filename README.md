# Weather app
This app was built as part of the [SheCodes React course](https://www.shecodes.io/workshops)

## The app
This weather app shows you the current weather (temperature, humidity, and wind) and forecast for any city of your choice, either through the search function or based on the location you are at. It also toggles between celsius and fahrenheit to show the current temperature. 

## Tech stack
The app is built with React and uses the OpenWeather API to fetch the current weather data and the forecast.
